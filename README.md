# number-guessing-game
A simple number guessing game.
The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100 in twenty guesses or less. Maybe twenty guesses is too much, but it can be easily adjusted. It would definitely need a downward adjustment if the game is changed to give indications of whether the player's guess is too high or too low.
The game uses Javascript, no jQuery. Also, no images or sounds. The balloon for the winners and the skull for the losers are emoji, but are not absolutely essential.
